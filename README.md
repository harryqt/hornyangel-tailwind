# ðŸ˜„ Tailwind + Svelte Practice

This project is not meant to be an exact clone, but rather a practice exercise to see how easy it is to build UIs with **Tailwind CSS** and **Svelte**.

Following a modern _mobile-first_ approach, as recommended by Google â€” so far, only the mobile version has been implemented.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Git** â†’ `brew install git`
- **Bun** â†’ `brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repository and start the development server:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/harryqt/hornyangel-tailwind
cd hornyangel-tailwind
bun install
bun dev
```
